# Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
Polls not displaying on https://sspulse.vercel.app/dapp because:
1. Users connecting to Base Mainnet (8453) instead of Base Sepolia (84532)
2. Contract address showing as `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
3. Environment variables not being read in Vercel

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ✅ Hardcoded Fallback Address
**File:** `lib/contracts/contract-config.ts`
- Added hardcoded Base Sepolia contract address: `0xa3713739c39419aA1c6daf349dB4342Be59b9142`
- This ensures the app works even without environment variables

### 2. ✅ Changed Default Network
**File:** `lib/wagmi.ts`
- Changed `defaultNetwork` from `base` to `baseSepolia`
- Users will now connect to Base Sepolia by default

### 3. ✅ Added Network Switcher Button
**File:** `app/dapp/page.tsx`
- Added prominent warning when user is on wrong network
- One-click "Switch to Base Sepolia" button
- Clear visual feedback with amber background

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Debugging
**Files:** `lib/contracts/contract-config.ts`, `app/dapp/page.tsx`
- Console logs for environment variables
- Chain ID and contract address logging
- Better error messages

### 5. ✅ Improved User Experience
**File:** `app/dapp/page.tsx`
- Polls now visible without wallet connection (voting still requires connection)
- Clear messaging about network requirements
- Better empty states with actionable guidance

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)
Just push these changes and redeploy to Vercel. The hardcoded fallback will make it work immediately.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add Base Sepolia contract fallback and network switcher"
git push
```

### Option 2: Proper Setup (For Production)
1. Set environment variables in Vercel:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=f9e8d0be09239678eb32ad9dcdcc47aa
     NEXT_PUBLIC_POLLS_CONTRACT_BASE_SEPOLIA=0xa3713739c39419aA1c6daf349dB4342Be59b9142
     ```
2. Redeploy

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit https://sspulse.vercel.app/dapp
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for:
   ```
   === CONTRACT CONFIG DEBUG ===
   CONTRACT_ADDRESSES: { 8453: {...}, 84532: { POLLS_CONTRACT: '0xa37...' } }
   
   === DAPP PAGE DEBUG ===
   Chain ID: 84532
   Contract Address: 0xa3713739c39419aA1c6daf349dB4342Be59b9142
   ```
4. If you see Chain ID 8453, click the "Switch to Base Sepolia" button
5. Polls should now display

## Expected Behavior

### Before Wallet Connection
- ✅ Polls are visible (read-only)
- ✅ Stats show correct numbers
- ✅ Message: "Connect wallet to vote on polls"

### After Connecting to Base Sepolia
- ✅ Polls are interactive
- ✅ Can vote on polls
- ✅ Can create new polls

### If Connected to Wrong Network
- ✅ Warning banner appears
- ✅ "Switch to Base Sepolia" button visible
- ✅ One-click network switch
